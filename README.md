In this project I will build nice profile card. Manipulate on backgrounds and create some cool effects. Project will be built based on HTML and CSS.
* Hover the girl image for 3s, 
* So when the 1st transition of box shadow end.

### Viewport Units
* Viewport Height (vh) = mean how many percent of viewport you want hight to be.
* Viewport Width (vw)  = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.

### CSS Gradients
CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines two types of gradients:

* Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
* Radial Gradients (defined by their center)


### CSS position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed or sticky)

### CSS box-shadow Property
The box-shadow CSS propertry adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set muliple dffects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radii, and color.

### CSS object-fit Property
When the image it doesn't have a shape or square then I just need to use object-fit with value cover.
